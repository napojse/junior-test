- install composer dependencies
- project should be ready on URL http://localhost/
- create sub dirs `napojse_test/log` and `napojse_test/temp`

Entities and repositories
-------------
- create Doctrine entity `User` into folder `app\Entity` with attributes `$id` (auto increment), `$email` (required unique string), `$password` (required string), `$fullName` (optional nullable string). The repository should be a descendant of `AbstractEntity`
- create Doctrine repository for entity `User` into folder `app\Service`. The repository should be a descendant of `AbstractRepository`

- run Doctrine command to create database tables: `php bin/console orm:schema-tool:create`

UI
